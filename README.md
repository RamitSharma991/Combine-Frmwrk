- Combine is a functionally reactive programming framework. Its used to react to constantly changing environment in the app through functional programming paradigms.
- In this we can use streams of events, values and apply operators like map, flatmap from func. prog. Its pretty similar to Rx Swift framework.
- This includes getting a value of network call or a button press then adding values through (example) pipeline of operators like mapping etc, then creating something usable(like new publishers) in other place.
- Its first party unlike RxSwift, better sementically and naming.
- It has operators like map, flatMap, compactMap, replaceError
