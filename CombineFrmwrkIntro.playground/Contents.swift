import Combine
import Foundation

//Combine framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time.
// These values can represent many kinds of async events
// Combine declares publishers to expose values that can change over time And subscribers to recieve those values from the publishers


// Combine is a functionally reactive programming framework. Its used to react to constantly changing environment in the app through functional programming paradigms.
// In this we can use streams of events, values and apply operators like map, flatmap from func. prog. Its pretty similar to Rx Swift framework.



// The publisher protocol declares a type that can deliver a sequence of values over time
// Publishers have operators to act on the values recieved from upstream publishers and republish them
// At the end of th chain of publishers, a subscriber acts on elements as it recieves them. Publishers only emit values when explicitly requested to do so by subs. This puts subs code in control of how fast it recieves events from the publishers its connected to.

// Publisher defines how values and errors are produced
// They are structs of value type
// allows registeration of a subscriber


// Subscriber recieves values and a completion
// potential completion a referece type


//Operators
// Adopts Publisher
// describes behaviour for changing values
// subscribe to a publisher : upstream
// sends results to a subscriber: downstream
//value type


//Special Subscriber
// sink(recieveCompletion: recieveValue)
// assign(to: on:)
